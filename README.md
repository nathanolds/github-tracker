# Github-Tracker

This is part of the coding challenge in LAP 3 at the futureproof bootcamp. This mini-project involves creating an app that uses the Github API to fetch data on users and their repositories. This data is then rendered. We have used React to build the front-end and display the data. The data was fetched using Axios.

## Running the project locally

### 1. Install the dependencies

```
$ npm i
```

At a minimum, [Node 17.0.1](https://nodejs.org/en/) must be installed.

### 2. Running the App

```
$ npm start
```

The locally hosted web-app will open in your browser.
